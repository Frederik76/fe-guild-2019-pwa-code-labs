Communication channels such as social media, emails, and in-app notifications are great, but they don’t always grab the attention of the user, especially when the user navigates away from the website.</p><p>This is where push notifications come in. They’re those helpful notifications that appear on your device that prompt you about information that could be useful to you. You can swipe or tap away to close them, or you can tap them and be instantly directed to a web page with the relevant information. Traditionally, only native applications had this amazing ability to tap into the operating system of a device and send push notifications. This is where PWAs are a game changer. They have the ability to receive push notifications that appear in the browser.</p><p>The best thing about push notifications is that the user receives them even when they aren't browsing your site. The experience looks and feels like a native app and works even if the browser isn't running. This makes it a perfect way to engage with users and draw them back to your web app even if they haven't opened the browser in a while. For example, if your website is a weather application, a push notification could provide your users with useful information such as warnings about approaching bad weather. You could even schedule weekly weather forecasts that can be sent as a push notification, depending on how your users subscribe. The possibilities are endless.</p><p>But what about malicious websites using this technology to send spammy push notifications? In order to send push messages to a user, the user first needs to opt in to your messages.Once a user has either accepted or blocked the push notification prompt, the prompt won't appear again. It's important to note that that this prompt will only appear if the site is running over HTTPS, has a registered Service Worker, and you have written code for it.</p><h2><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></h2><ul class="checklist"><li>Subscribing to notifications</li><li>VAPID protocol</li><li>Sending notifications</li><li>Receiving and interacting with notifications</li><li>Unsubscribing</li></ul><h2><strong>What you'll need</strong></h2><ul><li>Chrome 67, Edge 17, Firefox 61, Opera 44 or above</li><li>Your favorite text editor</li><li>Basic knowledge of HTML and JSON</li></ul></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Getting set up" duration="3"><h2>Project Set Up</h2><p>In this code lab we are building on top of the project started in the <code>IKeeping your data synchronized with BackgroundSync API</code> code lab.</p><p>If you didn't do it already: <strong>Fork</strong> and then <strong>Clone</strong> the following repository: <code>https://github.com/The-Guide/fe-guild-2019-pwa.git</code></p><pre><code>

If they accept, you can save their subscription details on the server and use them to send notifications later. These subscription details are unique to each user, device, and browser, so if a user logs in to your site on multiple devices, they'll be prompted once per device.</p><p>Once they've accepted, you can use these stored subscription details to send messages to a user later with a scheduled task that updates users with timely information.</p><p>Before you can start sending notifications to a user, you need to ask their permission by displaying a prompt. This prompt functionality is built into the browser by default, but first you need to add a little code to ensure that this prompt is initiated. If a user accepts the prompt, you'll be provided with a subscription object containing information about their subscription. But if a user denies the prompt, you won't be able to send them any messages, and they won't be prompted again. This ensures that you aren't able to annoyingly prompt users every time they visit your site.</p><h2>User permissions</h2><p>In <code>app.js</code></p><pre><code>
const enableNotificationsButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.enable-notifications');

const askForNotificationPermission = () =&gt; {
    Notification.requestPermission(result=&gt; {
        console.log('User Choice', result);
        if (result !== 'granted') {
            console.log('No notification permission granted!');
        } else {
            console.log('Notification permission granted!');
        }
    });
};

if ('Notification' in window) {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; enableNotificationsButtons.length; i++) {
        enableNotificationsButtons[i].style.display = 'inline-block';
        enableNotificationsButtons[i].addEventListener('click', askForNotificationPermission);
    }
}
</code></pre><h3>Explanation</h3><p>We ask the user for permission when clicking any of the <code>Enable Notifications</code> buttons. The buttons should be visible only if the browser supports notifications.</p><p>Also in <code>app.css</code></p><pre><code>
.enable-notifications {
    display: none;
}
</code></pre></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Displaying a Notification" duration="7"><p>Instead of logging to the console let's show a notification to the user when we receive permissions</p><p>In <code>app.js</code></p><pre><code>
const displayConfirmNotification = () =&gt; {
    const options = {
        body: 'You successfully subscribed to our Notification service!'
    };
    new Notification('Successfully subscribed!', options);
};

const askForNotificationPermission = () =&gt; {
    Notification.requestPermission(result=&gt; {
        console.log('User Choice', result);
        if (result !== 'granted') {
            console.log('No notification permission granted!');
        } else {
            displayConfirmNotification();
        }
    });
};
</code></pre><h3>Notifications options</h3><p>Notifications can be sent from the <code>Service Worker</code> registraton and can receive an <code>options</code> object that can control both the <code>visual</code> and <code>behavioral</code> aspect of the notification.</p><p>In <code>app.js</code></p><pre><code>
const displayConfirmNotification = () =&gt; {
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        const options = {
            body: 'You successfully subscribed to our Notification service!',
            icon: 'src/images/icons/app-icon-96x96.png',
            image: 'src/images/main-image-sm.jpg',
            dir: 'ltr',
            lang: 'en-US', // BCP 47,
            vibrate: [100, 50, 200],
            badge: 'src/images/icons/app-icon-96x96.png'
        };

        navigator.serviceWorker.ready
            .then(sw =&gt; sw.showNotification('Successfully subscribed (from SW)!', options));
    }
};
</code></pre><p>And, for example in my case on Windows 10, you should be able to see something like this</p><p style="display:flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"><img src="[[rootPath]]images/labs/web-push/notification.png"></p><p>Options can be any of the following:</p><pre><code>

There are also options that alter the behaviour of notifications.</p><p>By default, calling <code>showNotification()</code> with just visual options will have the following behaviours:</p><ul><li>Clicking on the notification does nothing.</li><li>Each new notification is shown one after the other. The browser will not collapse the notifications in any way.</li><li>The platform may play a sound or vibrate the user's devices (depending on the platform).</li><li>On some platforms the notification will disappear after a short period of time while others will show the notification unless the user interacts with it. (For example, compare your notifications on Android and Desktop.)</li></ul><p>In this step we are going to look at how we can alter these default behaviours using options alone. These are relatively easy to implement and take advantage of.</p><h3>Notification Click Event</h3><p>When a user clicks on a notification the default behaviour is for nothing to happen. It doesn't even close or remove the notification.</p><p>The common practice for a notification click is for it to close and perform some other logic (i.e. open a window or make some API call to the application).</p><p>To achieve this we need to add a <code>notificationclick</code> event listener to our service worker. This will be called when ever a notification is clicked.</p><p>In <code>sw-template.js</code></p><pre><code>
self.addEventListener('notificationclick', event =&gt; {
    const notification = event.notification;
    const action = event.action;

    console.log(notification);

    if (action === 'confirm') {
        console.log('Confirm was chosen');
        notification.close();
    } else {
        console.log(action);
        notification.close();
    }
});

self.addEventListener('notificationclose', event =&gt; console.log('Notification was closed', event));
